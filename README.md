Task 2 Data Science Internship Repository Overview

The repository encompasses the code and analysis conducted during Task 2 of my Data Science internship at Prodigy Info Tech. The task primarily involved comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a self-selected dataset. In this context, I opted to analyze the renowned Titanic dataset sourced from Kaggle.  

## Dataset
The <a href = "[https://github.com/kindo-tk/PRODIGY_DS_02/blob/main/Titanic-Dataset.csv](https://github.com/saivardhan507/PRODIGY_DS_02/blob/5f7ce6269cb203cb447af0a692f1d5695df296b5/Titanic-Dataset.csv)">`Titanic dataset`</a> is a well-known dataset in the field of data science and contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographics and survival status. This dataset is widely used for educational purposes and provides an opportunity to explore various data analysis techniques.

## Task Description
Main Objective:
The primary goal of this task entailed executing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to yield comprehensive insights from the Titanic dataset. The process encompassed addressing missing values and delving into the interrelationships between variables to discern pertinent patterns and trends within the dataset..


## Analysis Highlights
- Conducted data cleaning to handle missing values and duplicates.
- Explored relationships between variables such as gender, passenger class, age, fare, and survival rate.
- Identified patterns and trends in the data, including the higher survival rate among females, the impact of passenger class on survival, and the relationship between age and survival.

## Conclusion
The data cleaning and exploratory data analysis performed on the Titanic dataset provided valuable insights into the factors influencing survival rates during the Titanic disaster. This analysis contributes to a better understanding of historical events and showcases the application of data science techniques in deriving meaningful insights from data.
